    <title>HAMMING DISTANCE OF TWO DNA</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>HAMMING DISTANCE OF TWO <span style="color: crimson">DNA</span></h1>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your body is made up of cells that <br> 
        contain DNA. Those cells regularly<br>  
        wear out and need replacing, which <br> 
        they achieve by dividing into daughter <br> 
        cells. In fact, the average human <br> 
        body experiences about 10 quadrillion <br> 
        cell divisions in a lifetime!
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cells divide, their DNA replicates<br> 
        too. Sometimes during this process mistakes <br> 
        happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded <br> 
        with the incorrect information. If we compare <br> 
        two strands of DNA and count the differences <br> 
        between them we can see how many mistakes <br> 
        occurred. This is known as the "Hamming <br> 
        Distance".</p>
